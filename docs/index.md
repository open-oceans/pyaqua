Aqualink is a philanthropic engineering organization working on building ocean conservation technology. Read more about their [inspiration, smart buoy, and web application](https://aqualink.org/about). This tool is designed to help interact programmatically with the [Aqualink.org map](https://aqualink.org/map) and is not based on any official API so expect features to break once in a while.
